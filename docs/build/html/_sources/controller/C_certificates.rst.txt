Certificates
============

The certificate chain of Guardian is 

::
   
   S15 Root CA
   |
   +--S15 QKD intermediate CA
      |
      +--KME operator intermediate CA (kme)
         |
         +--Internal Intermediate CA (generated by ``cert_auth``)
         |  |
         |  +-- Vault server certificate
         |  +-- Vault client certificate (``vault_init``)
         |
         +--Vault PKI engine Intermediate CA 
            |
            +-- Service client certificates, ``rest``, ``watcher``
            +-- SAE client certificates
 

In order to verify an identity through TLS mutual authentication, both server and client present their certificates with or without their CA chain. They will then verify the others certificates with their trusted CA chains to determine the authenticity of the certificates before deciding to continue with the connection.


Additional Clients
------------------

To add additional individual SAE clients, they will need to present their Certificate Signing Request to be signed by the Vault PKI engine Intermediate CA. The mandatory identifiers are 

   #. Country
   
   #. State

   #. Locality
   
   #. Organisation Unit
   
   #. Common Name
